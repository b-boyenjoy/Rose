This folder is for game assets like images, sounds, and fonts.

For actual gameplay, you'll want to create or source:
1. A club exterior background image (place it at assets/club-exterior.png)
2. Character sprites 
3. NPC sprites
4. Sound effects and music

The game currently uses emoji and CSS for visuals, but you can enhance it by adding proper graphical assets.

Example of how to create a simple club-exterior.png:
- Create an 800x600 image with a dark street background
- Add neon lighting effects
- Add a club entrance with "ROSE" in pink neon
- Save as PNG in this directory
